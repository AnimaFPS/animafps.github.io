Aim Lab [announced on the 11th of July](https://twitter.com/aimlab/status/1414636002459766784?s=20) 2021 that they are going to be doing a competition for all the big aim groups/communities with a $50,000 prize pool on the 17th of the same month. Each of the top aim groups was nominated and sent 2 representatives each to compete for a part of the prize pool. The entries and the groups that they were representing were:

- **[Voltaic](https://twitter.com/VoltaicHQ):** [Lorys](https://twitter.com/lorysXO), [Deth\_Skull](https://twitter.com/DethUnderscore)
- **[Yuki Aim](https://twitter.com/YukiAim):** [Succhi](https://twitter.com/Scucchi97), [Unans](https://twitter.com/rA_Unans)

- **Individual:** [TenZ](https://twitter.com/TenZOfficial), [Gored](https://twitter.com/gorechamber)

### Format

The competition used the tasks: **SPIDERSHOT PRECISION** , **rA 1w4ts** , **rA b180** , **rA RTH** , **ARCTRACK STANDARD** , **WALLPEAK EXPERT** , **voxtargetswitch (Aqua)**, **rA kinTS** , **rA hebeTS**. The format was a single-elimination bracket with bo3 sets of 3 tasks with each task being from a different aiming category changing each round. To win each map was the highest total amount of points scored across 3 runs.

## The Competition

It was very close for most if not all of the rounds with the first round being the most decisive except for Lorys vs Unans with them trading tasks. Same with the second round with MBM and trustemix just slipping ahead in both of their tasks.

The final was so tense truly a battle for the ages with trustemix getting insane runs on the first task of **rA 1w4ts** and getting the first point. Next was **ARCTRACK STANDARD** with both once again being so close with them avenging 94%!!!! accuracy but MBM pulled a 96% run again just pulling ahead of truste pushing them to a last and final task **rA hebeTS**. This is when it got turned up, trustemix took the first run with only 11 targets ahead of MBM. Then it flipped for the next run with MBM only 1 target ahead of trustemix so the last and final run for MBM to catch up 10 targets!!! But it was too far for MBM and trustemix was too consistent so he won and took out the entire competition. [Winning run](https://twitter.com/aimlab/status/1416533789724053507?s=20)

On top of this $50,000 challenge, there was a slightly smaller but still huge $10,000 showmatch where they only played **GRIDSHOT** bo3 featuring some popular creators sponsored by Aim Lab. The creators invited to participate were:

- [TenZ](https://twitter.com/TenZOfficial)
- [ethos](https://twitter.com/ethoz)
- [Beyn](https://twitter.com/BeYNvlrt)
- [Horcus](https://twitter.com/HorcusCSGO)
- [FoxA](https://twitter.com/FoxA_R6)
- [ZexRow](https://twitter.com/TSM_ZexRow)
- [Kariyu](https://twitter.com/KariyuOT)

The Finals were between ZexRow and Kariyu which just like the invitational main tournament it was very close so close in fact the final score difference was 2-3 targets clicked difference(596 points to be exact). So Kariyu took home $10,000 and again just like the main event all the players in the tournament took home $3,000.

## The Future

This competition is a big sign that no matter how much push back by the general gaming community about the use and need of aim training and validated and adds the possibility of this being a proper esport. While it's not the first competition with prize money with [Revosect](https://twitter.com/revosect) having fortnightly competitions for up to $1000 but it's a much bigger step with much more exposure. Aim Lab have said that they are wanting to host more of these $50,000 skill challenges in the future which is so good with just backing the community and this for a lot longer. We might even see the prize pool and the competitions grow much larger with different formats, teams, players, and ways to experience all the action.

With all this outsider publicity on the community is so good for its health and the future looks bright. It's pushing the community(and specifically all the great discords and groups that are so passionate about aiming) into the spotlight and really going to start growing in size and knowledge exponentially. Aim Lab are making strides and putting a lot of effort into the community and listening to quite a lot of stuff and with the recent updates and the announcement of Playerbase supporting the coaches and creators. They are promoting themselves to all of the community as the best for everyone so KovaaKs is surely feeling a bit threatened as the previous favourite among the competitive aiming community now losing a lot of people. Only time will tell and personally really hope that it can develop and bring so much more into the community.

Are you excited about the growth of competitive aiming?
