For some of you keen-eyed people, you would have noticed that after a fun time on Twitter and subsequent dm's I made quite an exit from gaming content especially the aiming community. I have and am going to stop for the foreseeable future with gaming tip/theory content and going to focus more on math, comp sci and philosophy content while there may be an intersection from time to time with gaming it won't be the focus rather its application as an example. As well as various articles about interesting stuff from the various things I do.

So lookout for more content, more essays and more stuff I can pull from my brain. This you can do by subscribing because I won't be posting new stuff on Twitter till I feel comfortable again(where I can focus on helping and get over personal issues) or a rebrand so that is the best and only real way to get to know when I post new stuff.

Might as well just finish up a couple of projects I was making before I took a break which may not quite fit what the future of this is going to be but I want people still to have the information. Plus the aim resources will not be maintained which really sucks but I don't have the time or the motivation to get back into the community so if anyone wants to become a maintainer you can email me at [animafps@protonmail.com](mailto:animafps@protonmail.com) because it should still have support to stop just all the resources being attached to a brand of an organization and restricting knowledge.

Let's see what this new chapter of my content can bring.
