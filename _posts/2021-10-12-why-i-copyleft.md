If you notice on the footer of this page, it shows a notice saying that this
website is licensed under CC BY-SA which is quite an open license.
It is the license that is regarded as a _CopyLeft_ license.
&nbsp;As well as my many maintained and created software/library repositories
are licensed under GPLv3 and AGPLv3 which are both copyleft licenses.

Copyleft is a play on the normal term of copyright but to be much more open and
avoid all rights reserved. As well it's associated with the free culture
movement as it is approved for the use for _free cultural works_ as defined by [freedomdefined.org](https://freedomdefined.org).

So why do I license my work to make it freer?

## Why Free Cultural Works

For everything that I make, it is made free. This covers everything from
programs I code to the various essays I have and will publish to the full array
of guides that I have written. Not just free in terms of price or availability
but free as people are free to modify, share and have unrestricted access
to the vast collection of stuff. That's what makes copyleft, copyleft.

Now,
why do I even bother with this stuff to make it _free cultural works_ anyway?
Well, first with the educational/guides it's to reach the largest amount of
people by nature of it being freer to access. Also provides this large base
with good information because the internet is filled right to the top with some
rather dodgy advice and information so giving people more rights to share and
do more with the content and by proxy, the information gets out to more people
with more streams. While if it gets modified more and more it might lose a bit
of the original information but I know that my stuff is not the sole truth of
all information I share and new ideas and information gets found and thought
about every day so it can evolve and make the great stuff even better with time
and fix my own errors and misinformation.

For stuff like my code, I want people to use it in every application they like
plus the same note that it reaches more people through the amazing
FOSS community and its discovery tools. With copyleft, it looks at freedom of
the work plus the redistribution of the remixed and adapted work which
is important for software.

## Permissive Licenses

The software ecosystem revolves around the sharing of information and little
code snippets but often once they enter this system they get lost without an
owner forever. While little snippets are not licensable this ecosystem applies
to a lot of larger works. This brings up a great example of
&nbsp;Andrew Tanenbaum, who released MINIX, an operating system,
under a BSD license. Intel swept MINIX and used it to make
the Intel Management Engine (which was possible due to the licensing),
making it the OS of the spyware microprocessor/backdoor now running in all
Intel CPUs. Even if this OS has become the most used OS because of its
large implementation the permissive license allowed Intel to take it
from Tanenbaum and make the source of it closed.

It completely removes the programmer from the program when distributed and with
guides and such with copyleft, you get the credit for your work when it
inevitably gets modified and redistributed.

### Why ShareAlike

With the example of Tanenbaum, the source code of Intel Management Engine
was completely closed off so they could make it into the spyware that it became
with the basic work done by Tanenbaum. The extent and full known use of the IME
are still kinda unknown because of this fact and without open source code,
no one can see it.

So this is why I like ShareAlike licenses, while ShareAlike is the term used by
Creative Commons it's a good term to describe the use of a clause in a license
that requires all modifications that are distributed to be under the same or
equivalent license/license terms. So this means that it has to be open source
for all future distributions which solves this issue from the example above for
software but it is also helpful with documents.

With another example with guides and such, using a ShareAlike means that the
knowledge becomes virally free. All the information that gets added on in
remixes and modifications compounds and has to be released so that people can
do the same. So we all win.

### Commercial

While you can also conclude that ShareAlike is restrictive for all the
licensing that goes forward and we should just stop companies from using these
programs like MINIX in commercial products and solutions with a non-commercial
clause. But it goes against the philosophy of free cultural works which should
not deny access to this because of intentions because something like
newsletters or software CDs are distributing the work and doing it for a
commercial benefit but it's not nefarious. Plus there are thousands of
situations where it doesn't restrict access to the source. Also, we want these
companies to help with the effort and it's much better to just release the
source or use ShareAlike compared to just not being able to use such a thing.

## Works of Opinion

This model might not work for every bit of my work though. Like my essays of
opinion. Like my
[labels essay]({% post_url 2021-09-04-labels-and-its-adhesive %}) which
expresses just a bit of my opinion and the issue that arises is if it gets
modified and kind of loses its original meaning.
Where the no derivativesclause comes in, which prohibits the distribution
of modified copies and has to be copied and shared verbatim.
While the information might be shared that is noteworthy in terms of content
that is theories which could be added on to by derivatives with another license
it's just not worth and can still have excerpts extracted.

## Conclusion: Freedom of Information

All information should be free to be accessed and redistributed so no one
entity owns the power and the knowledge. I for one am going to share my
thoughts so it can help all who might be interested and share, collate
and create better ways to unite information to be free and accessible for you.

If we get more information and code out the more we all benefit so if you are
writing an essay or some code or a blog think if it could be a little freer.
