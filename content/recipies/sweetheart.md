title: Sweetheart Cocktail
---

## Prelude

Decided this year to make something special for valentines day, and what is more romantic than a pink cocktail at a pub.

So decided to use the huge ammounts of rose wine that we have lying around. 

This is a tweaked version of the [Elle Loves cocktail by Simon Gifford](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/3330/elle-loves-cocktail)

focusing on the raspberry notes from our rose on hand.

**Review**: Fruity, sweet and lightly pink in colour

## Recipie

### Ingredients

 - 30ml Sweet Rose wine (I used Peregine)
 - 40ml Pineapple Juice
 - 45ml White Rum
 - 10ml Raspberry Syrup

### Method

Shake all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass (served in coupe)
