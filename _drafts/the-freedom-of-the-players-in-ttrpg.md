In the past 6-ish months I have been active within my friend group playing the full array of tabletop role-playing games and one thing that has interested me was how different GMs manage their players. Specifically making sure there is a balance of freedom for the players to create a story for their characters and the plot which is often planned by the GM.

This is one of the extremes that can happen and have seen where the GM has not much of a way to lead the players down a path and leave all of the work of creating the scene to the players while this description is on the very extreme side.
