About 2 years ago I started aim training and
one thing that I found extremely helpful was a gist by Nut
outlining 3 levels of tracking technique and tips to improve at each level.
But unfortunately, they have taken it down so I am going to try to do the same and
a little better with the knowledge that they didn't have back 2 years ago.

Just like their document, this is going to be split into 3 parts consisting of

- Beginner - For people who have just started learning about technique and
  don't have much of an idea of a correct technique/style
- Intermediate - For people who are well into their aim journey and
  understand the basic terminologies and techniques but lack the application
- Advanced - People who are reaching the top and
  are looking for that little bit more edge on their technique

## Beginner

The main thing with beginners is the lack of smoothness often with the crosshair and mouse movement being quite jittery. So when tracking a target be conscious of the tenseness of your arm & hand/grip and see if you can reduce the pressure and consciously counteract the jittering of the muscles.

Another thing is just raising the awareness of your crosshair when it may go off-target to then more quickly react to that change.

## Intermediate

Intermediate is focusing on doing a lot of the beginner stuff faster. Like utilizing your awareness to use hitsounds and hitmarkers to assist the reaquiring of the target when it may change speed or direction or when your crosshair/mouse is moving faster than the target. And using this skill to combat trailing and leading.

## Advanced

With more advanced players you have a lot of control but it's about maximizing that for the longest time. You have to reduce the average distance of correction needed when a target changes speed or direction. This means if the target is moving horizontally only then track on the trailing edge or as close as you can to that point or when it is moving both horizontally and vertically then the point changes to the exact middle of the target.

As well while this may contradict the beginner advice,
you can put a little more tension into your arm to jitter aim but use it consciously for micro-adjustments back onto that point I talked about earlier.
