title: The Technologies I am Learning in 2022

description: The world of programming is growing so quick so here is my short list of tech that I want to learn in the new year
---

Saw a [recent video by Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQzrGffpIGI)
where he outlined what technologies he wants to learn in this new year.
So I decided to follow what he does.

## What I Learned in 2021

2021 was my biggest year for improving my skills and knowledge of many technologies
for the many many projects that I undertook.

### Rust Lang

From the start of the year I had an interest in learning rust
because of how important memory safe application are and
everything connected to it.
On top of all of that I really wanted to learn more low level languages,
I already knew C# and C from previous years as that was the first lang I learned
but wanted something more than that as C based code was only really useful for
legacy codebases which are already being slowly converted to faster and safer languages.
While I learned the basics around the syntax and memory features I never got around
to actually code anything with it which truly unfortunate because I didn't get the
full hang of it or had a use in my current stack or projects I was interested in.
So maybe this year I can write some code in this very cool lang.

### [Astro](https://astro.build)

This is a more recent find and learn but astro changed
this entire website.
For the 5th time this website got a rework this time with a new tool called astro.
Astro is a website framework that allows components from any framework to be embeded
as well as it being built on the idea of island architecture and
partial hydration of components which lead to a really fast website.
On top of this website I have plans to convert most if not all of
my documentation sites to astro this year.

### Svelte

Connected to astro is me learning svelte to write components for this website.

### Service Workers/CF Workers

For one of my previous iterations of this website I decided to have a go at implementing
progressive web app functionality with a service worker.
So there would be caching and offline viewing of the blog posts while this
hasn't lasted into this site its given me the skills to use cloudflare workers.
While I am using for so many different things from pinging fpsmath to
being a handler of webhooks and proxying api calls.
So many possibilities and this for sure is staying within my stack.

## To Learn in 2022

Here is my short and not final list of things I want to explore this year:

### [Go Lang](https://go.dev)

Like 2021 I want to give myself the goal to learn a new language.
This time with rust's rival *Go* because of its simple syntax that I
can pick up from C.
Plus because of that simplicity I can write more optimized programs
even if its not to the level of memory safety that rust has.
Which just makes it really suited for me to write programs with it
this year and excited to see what I can do with it.
At the point of writing this I am already learning it.

### [Turbo Repo](https://turborepo.org/)

Just like Ben, I too want to learn and use turbo in my future mono repo projects.
It just looks so good to improve speed of development within these repositories.

### [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and DBs

As I try to become more of a well rounded dev to improve the quality of all my projects
which requires me to learn databases and ORMs
as most of my projects are stateless applications.
From what I have seen and read about prisma is that it really improves interactions
with a database and code quality around it so that when I do require a database
its less prone to errors with its great integration with typescript.

### [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim)

While I dabbled into using motion graphics and graphs in the last few videos
I have made, I really want to improve video quality and explore more topics in-depth
with better explanations through these graphics.

### Computer Science

I am starting my computer science course for uni this year
so on top of all these technologies
I'm excited to learn all that comp sci has to offer to learn and improve
my knowledge and skills.
