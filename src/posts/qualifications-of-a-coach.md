Gaming coaches especially aim coaches popping up in the
immensely toxic/gatekeeping environment
to start to help people develop and become a coach but
what are the true qualifications/requirements to become one.
People will always throw around arbitrary requirements such as
needing to be a top performer but something like this should always
be a tiny part of what makes a good coach.

Recommended Prerequisite reading by RESPRiT: [What is a Coach, Really?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ZzH0-QiD45Zh9gqxOBp0585q7YkqkKccSKx2en84mI/edit)

## Basic Qualifications

- Have qualification or experience in teaching, analysis, or tutoring.
- Have significant experience, understanding and active involvement in the
specified activity.

### Evaluation of a Coach

To arbitrarily evaluate someone's strategy or theory analysis ability on
statistics like accuracy, KDR, and win/loss in a ranked situation is not the
most effective way to show competency in coaching and analysis.

It can be an indicator of pure mechanical expertise which is an important factor
in overall skill, but there are more important skills to expound upon, such as
communication, goal-oriented achievements, adapting to new situations and
styles of encounter. These are things not every top performer can do.

For many players, their performance doesn't always come from an explicit
understanding of the tasks at hand. So they may not always fit the qualification
of understanding the activity enough to analyse other players' performance.

### Different Levels of Coaching

When thinking about this you have to split the different levels of coaching and
people's proficiency with coaching qualifications or experience coaching like a
coach focusing on new players requires knowledge of many different methods of
teaching and to be highly adaptable. This is the case because of the greater
number of beginners and the often lack of exposure to the correct techniques
and methods of the players above their skill.

While then a coach who focuses on the best of the best is the proficiency of the
analysis and development of techniques and less on adapting to the player cause
most likely the player has and can learn to the strategies with analysis and
their own experience to have the range of developed skills

But things like a beginner coach can be trained outside of the field or game as
more people have gone through to the level that they are training too and it's
about refining the fundamental skills and giving that range to help more people.

## Gatekeeping Culture

Now with a lot of the gaming community(even more so in the aiming community),
there is a huge toxic environment surrounding the thing as simple as helping
people. Often again they are always focused on how proficient people are within
the field rather than the skills that I have talked about above. This makes
sense for a surface level opinion because there is solid evidence correlating
performance with knowing how to execute with proficiency. But it may not always
be the case for everyone as you can be good at a game without knowing how you
came to be good. But many popular coaches ignore this fact and all of the other
information I have laid out in the above sections, so we need to really analyse
these coaches and their motives behind this. Many popular coaches in various
fields use their popularity to make a kind of monopoly through campaigns to
takedown and harass people because of these aspects around their rank and such
when they are never a good thing to focus on for a coaches ability to coach.

To overcome this see when popular coaches do this and if they are focusing on
the right things and use the steps of evaluation to help with this.
We need to get rid of it in every field and promote quality coaches for their
coaching ability, not their ability to promote themselves.
Plus with this, you can help out coaches who you think do good coaching by
recommending them to others and such so we can get past these coaches who may
not always be worth people's money.

> Coaches should be seen as good and uplifted for their coaching,
not because of their reputation and popularity
