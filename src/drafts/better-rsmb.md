title: How Make Smooth Gaming Videos With Frame Interpolation
---

ReelSmart Motion Blur also known as RSMB is almost 12 years old and it shows
with artifacts, inconsistencies arround ui elements and transparent things.
On top its slow and lacks the propper controls for tweaking for certain use cases.
It has become the standard for motion blur effects in video game montages and fragmovies
but maybe its time to retire the old software for the new stuff.
