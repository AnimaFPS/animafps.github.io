With documents like [hoya's Mousepad Mastersheet](https://bit.ly/30cWlUe)
you can see the measured performance of a large selection of gaming mousepads.
Its well good having this large array of information but
how can we use it to choose a mousepad apart from finding ones that are
like pads that you have already tried/tested.
So there must be a better way that we can use to figure out a good way of
estimating the performance in your hands off the recorded speed alone.

There are two major components make up the performance of a pad:

## 1. Dynamic Friction

The first of the two is dynamic friction,
this is the friction that is most often associated and advertised with
mousepad and their speed/smoothness.
Dynamic Friction is the resistance force while moving your mouse and
across the mousepad has momentum.

## 2. Static Friction

This measurement is often overlooked when looking into a mousepad but
in my mind is the major one to look for.
The static friction of a mousepad describes
the force required to move the mouse from rest to any velocity.
We look at this as the jerk required to start moving your mouse.

## Fast versus Slow

Now that we have the two parts of mouse pad speed why do they matter?
Well
