For as long as I have been playing gaming competitively I always wanted to make my own ranking system because I found so many flaws in the ones at the time and it was a good way to combine multiple hobbies and interests with coding, mathematics and gaming into one project. With some research, I found Glicko-2 which is proposed as the successor to the Elo system which has been such a powerhouse in this space.

So I started with modifying an already existing implementation and adding some extra functions to work with ranking some games for the game that I was maining at the time, Diabotical ranking all the tournament games and players on my old website. But at the start of July 2021, my friends wanted to make a sort of tournament to see who the best gamer was so I took this opportunity to make a new implementation fully written in typescript which I learned to make [fpsmath]({% post_url portfolio/2021-09-04-fpsmath %}).
